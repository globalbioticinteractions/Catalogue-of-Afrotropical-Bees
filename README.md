Eardley C, Coetzer W. 2016. Catalogue of Afrotropical Bees. 

from http://doi.org/10.15468/u9ezbh : "The purpose of this catalogue is to list the valid names, nomenclatorial history of, and references citing, the described bees of sub-saharan Africa and the western Indian Ocean islands, excluding the honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus). The countries in which species occur are listed, as well as the type specimens/species of species/genera. Some ecological information is provided, namely flowers visited, plants used as nests, parasitic bees and host bees."

This repository points to the darwin core archive and help to index and integrate the catalogue with http://globalbioticinteractions.org .

If more species interaction datasets exists that have the same Darwin Core Archive structure, simply clone this repository and update the globi.json and accompanying README.
